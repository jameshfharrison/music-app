  I am currently in my fourth semester of the Computer Programming and Analysis
  Program at Seneca College.

  <br />
  I have previously completed a Bachelor of Arts at Queen's University in
  Political Science.

  In my free time, I like to play video games, read and run. An interesting
  project I have completed is a Twitch.tv bot for streamers.
